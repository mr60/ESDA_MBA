This paper explores the application of spatial analysis methods, in particular, Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA) to understand the relationship between green infrastructure (GI) location and their impact on resilience. This paper aims to answer the following questions: (i) if there is a spatial relationship between GI location in the system and their impact on resilience, and if such a relationship is detected, (ii) if spatial clusters and spatial outliers can be identified, and (iii) how these spatial relationships and spatial heterogeneities vary when using different types of GI and resilience indicators. A framework that integrates resilience assessment, location sensitivity analysis and exploratory spatial data analysis is presented. Applied to an urban catchment in the UK, the applicability and practical viability of the framework is shown. Evidence of spatial autocorrelation and clusters was detected for the different infrastructures and resilience indicators. The proposed framework can be used as complementary tool for GI spatial planning for resilience enhancement, where strategic locations for resilience enhancement can be detected.
